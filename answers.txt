Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: There really is no reason to use it, we have GitHub Desktop to 
make life easier. On top of that, there are better Git GUIs out there. 
But to answer your question, so that we can learn how to work with Linux 
systems which are more prevalent in the industry. When we need to run 
code on Linux system, we will most likely be using Git on command line 
to get our code from repositories that we wrote on. This process of 
writing code on one system and running code on a more powerful system is 
an integral part of data science.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: One field is stock trading. People use data science to track
stock behavior and use that as a basis for trading.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging directly combines 2 given branches, and depending on 
which branch is doing the mergine, that then becomes the new branch. 
Rebasing, on the other hand, is meant to update a branch with the latest 
updates to that branch's main stream. If there were updates to main and 
the branch user wants to bring those updates into their branch, they can 
do so using rebase. The main difference is that merging combines 
branches while rebase updates a branch based on its main.
