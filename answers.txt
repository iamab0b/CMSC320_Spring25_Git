Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: There really is no reason to use it, we have GitHub Desktop to 
make life easier. On top of that, there are better Git GUIs out there. 
But to answer your question, so that we can learn how to work with Linux 
systems which are more prevalent in the industry. When we need to run 
code on Linux system, we will most likely be using Git on command line 
to get our code from repositories that we wrote on. This process of 
writing code on one system and running code on a more powerful system is 
an integral part of data science.
